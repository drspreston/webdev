    "Words can't even describe how proud I am of the girls," Pearl River coach Sarah Smith said. "The team executed so
    well, not once but twice; in the most high-pressure situation that you can imagine. These girls are exceptional
    athletes. They are relentless in their daily pursuit of perfection, and it absolutely set them apart on the
    nationals floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    "The key to our victory was strong veteran leadership, focused athletes and high standards for all of our skills."
